Hey everyone,

- bootstrap environment
- ie8+ compatible
- includes are pre-built.
- db config pre-built and easy to input your db info.
- Lightbox 2 by Lokesh Dhakar
- References include.
- HTML5 shiv
- local jQuery
- respond.js
- svgeezy.js (fallback for svg elements that do not work in certain browsers, will pull like file with the extension of .png

Enjoy and let me know if you have any questions.
